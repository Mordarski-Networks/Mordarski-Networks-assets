# smordarski's filter list

A uBlock Origin compliant filter list that blocks websites I deem unsafe or bad.

## What does this filter list block?

This filter blocks TikTok, Discord, and ROBLOX. My goal is to block websites that I deem are bad. I will try to add all fansites as well so you don't have to look at low quality content.

## How do I add this to uBlock Origin?

1. Open uBlock Origin's settings and go to "Filter lists"
2. Scroll to the bottom and select "Custom"
3. Put this as the URL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smordarski/smord-filter-list/main/filters/smord-filter-list.txt
4. Save
